## 🚀 Installation and Usage

### 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- ✅ **Flutter SDK** installed and configured
- ✅ **Cloudflare WARP client** (`warp-cli`) installed on Linux system
- ✅ **Linux dependencies** for Flutter development

### 🔧 Development Mode

Run the project in development mode:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/johnpetersa19/cloudflare_warp_panel.git](https://github.com/johnpetersa19/cloudflare_warp_panel.git)
cd cloudflare_warp_panel

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run in development mode
flutter run -d linux
```

### 📦 Production Build

To generate an optimized version for distribution:

```bash
# Generate release build
flutter build linux --release

# The executable will be available at:
# build/linux/x64/release/bundle/
```

### 🎯 Quick Installation

```bash
# Make the executable file executable
chmod +x build/linux/x64/release/bundle/cloudflare_warp_panel

# Run the application
./build/linux/x64/release/bundle/cloudflare_warp_panel
```

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application is built with a modular architecture:

- **Main Control Panel**: Central hub for connection management
- **Settings Dialogs**: Organized configuration windows
- **Command Executor**: Generic `warp-cli` command interface
- **Status Manager**: Real-time connection state monitoring
- **Data Persistence**: Uses `shared_preferences` for local storage of user preferences and statistics.
- **Speed Monitoring**: Uses `dart:io` `Process` to read network statistics from `/sys/class/net` and provides real-time animated display.

All functionality is based on the `_executeWarpCommand` function, which provides a standardized way to interact with the Cloudflare WARP CLI.
